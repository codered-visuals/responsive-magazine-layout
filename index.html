            a man, RED... if you will, is sitting on a bed smoking a cigarette. We see his back, but with each glow of the cigarette ash, we see his face reflected
        in the window in front of him. In the darkness, there starts the sound of a motor which draws curtains back across a large picture window just off screen. 
        As the curtain moves, hard-edged light begins crawling across the room... strangers who walk by can now see everything clearly.</p>
        Saturday morning</span> 03:00 AM somewhere... I am sitting here...typing... this - You dont know me.  And I dont know you. But one thing is for certain, I need to 
        start this channel...</p>
        <p>I hope to teach you new things along the way of learning code myself, focussing on html, css, scss, javascript & a little php when needed ;).  
            If at any time you have suggestions or feedback on the content, please leave a comment.</p>
            <p>Let's do this...</p>
